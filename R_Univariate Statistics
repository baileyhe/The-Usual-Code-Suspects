### UNIVARIATE STATISTICAL TESTS IN R ###

# =============================
# 1. INDEPENDENT T-TEST
# =============================
# Use: Compare means between two independent groups (assumes normality & equal variances).
# Data: Numeric outcome, binary grouping variable.
# Non-parametric alternative: Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mann-Whitney U).
# Example insight: "Thoroughbreds have significantly higher average race speeds than Arabians."

t.test(speed ~ breed, data = horse_data)

# =============================
# 2. WILCOXON RANK-SUM TEST
# =============================
# Use: Non-parametric alternative to t-test for two independent groups.
# Data: Ordinal or numeric outcome, binary group.
# Parametric alternative: t-test.
# Example insight: "Arabian horses tend to have lower endurance scores than Quarter Horses."

wilcox.test(endurance ~ breed, data = horse_data)

# =============================
# 3. PAIRED T-TEST
# =============================
# Use: Compare means in two related measurements (e.g., before/after).
# Data: Numeric, paired observations.
# Non-parametric alternative: Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
# Example insight: "Horse heart rate significantly decreased after a 10-minute cool-down."

t.test(heart_rate_before, heart_rate_after, paired = TRUE)

# =============================
# 4. WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST
# =============================
# Use: Non-parametric test for paired data (e.g., pre/post).
# Data: Numeric or ordinal, paired.
# Parametric alternative: Paired t-test.
# Example insight: "Horse anxiety ratings improved after switching to a natural pasture diet."

wilcox.test(anxiety_before, anxiety_after, paired = TRUE)

# =============================
# 5. ONE-WAY ANOVA
# =============================
# Use: Compare means across 3+ independent groups.
# Data: Numeric outcome, categorical group variable.
# Non-parametric alternative: Kruskal-Wallis test.
# Example insight: "Average jump height differs across horse training methods."

anova_result <- aov(jump_height ~ training_method, data = horse_data)
summary(anova_result)

# =============================
# 6. KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST
# =============================
# Use: Non-parametric ANOVA for 3+ groups.
# Data: Ordinal or numeric outcome, categorical group.
# Parametric alternative: One-way ANOVA.
# Example insight: "Temperament scores vary significantly across horse breeds."

kruskal.test(temperament ~ breed, data = horse_data)

# =============================
# 7. CHI-SQUARE TEST OF INDEPENDENCE
# =============================
# Use: Test association between two categorical variables.
# Data: 2-way contingency table.
# Alternative: Fisherâ€™s exact test (for small expected counts).
# Example insight: "There is an association between horse coat color and breed."

table_data <- table(horse_data$coat_color, horse_data$breed)
chisq.test(table_data)

# =============================
# 8. FISHER'S EXACT TEST
# =============================
# Use: Categorical association when expected counts are small (<5 in any cell).
# Data: 2x2 contingency table.
# Alternative: Chi-square test (for larger samples).
# Example insight: "A rare coat pattern is significantly more common in draft horses."

fisher.test(table_data)

# =============================
# 9. McNEMAR'S TEST
# =============================
# Use: Compare proportions in paired nominal data (e.g., pre/post yes/no).
# Data: 2x2 matrix of paired counts.
# Example insight: "More horses were reported as calm after using a new saddle pad than before."

mcnemar_matrix <- matrix(c(30, 10, 5, 55), nrow = 2,
                         dimnames = list("Before" = c("Calm", "Not_Calm"),
                                         "After" = c("Calm", "Not_Calm")))
mcnemar.test(mcnemar_matrix)

# =============================
# 10. COCHRAN'S Q TEST
# =============================
# Use: Like a repeated-measures chi-square for 3+ related binary variables.
# Data: Long format: binary outcome (0/1), repeated measures per subject.
# Example insight: "Horse response to three calming techniques differs significantly."

# Requires 'DescTools' package
# install.packages("DescTools")
library(DescTools)

# Example: binary responses from same horse to 3 techniques
# horse_id, method (A/B/C), responded (0/1)
# Data must be wide format (one row per horse)
cochran_data <- data.frame(
  horse = 1:10,
  method_A = c(1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0),
  method_B = c(0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1),
  method_C = c(1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0)
)

CochranQTest(cochran_data[, c("method_A", "method_B", "method_C")])

# Assuming each horse has yes/no responses across 3 sessions
# 1 = Yes (calm), 0 = No (not calm)

# install.packages("DescTools")
library(DescTools)

calming_responses <- data.frame(
  horse = 1:10,
  session1 = c(1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0),
  session2 = c(0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1),
  session3 = c(1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0)
)

# Cochran's Q test across 3 timepoints
CochranQTest(calming_responses[, c("session1", "session2", "session3")])
