### TIME SERIES ANALYSIS FOR HORSE DATA 🐎 ###

# Example dataset: Weekly stamina scores for a single horse
# horse_ts <- ts(horse_data$stamina, start = c(2024, 1), frequency = 52)

# 1. Plot the time series
plot(horse_ts, main = "Weekly Stamina Over Time", ylab = "Stamina Score", xlab = "Week")

# 2. Decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals
decomp <- decompose(horse_ts)
plot(decomp)

# 3. Autocorrelation: Check if current values depend on past values
acf(horse_ts, main = "ACF — Is stamina auto-correlated over time?")

# 4. Forecasting with ARIMA
# install.packages("forecast")
library(forecast)
model <- auto.arima(horse_ts)
forecast_result <- forecast(model, h = 10)
plot(forecast_result, main = "10-Week Forecast of Horse Stamina")

# 🐎 Example insight:
# "This horse’s stamina shows a gradual upward trend with weekly fluctuations.
# Forecasting suggests performance will peak around week 12 before stabilizing."
