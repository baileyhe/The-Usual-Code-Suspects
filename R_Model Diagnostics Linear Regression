### MODEL DIAGNOSTICS FOR LINEAR REGRESSION ###

# Fit a model: Predict race time from weight, heart rate, and breed
lm_model <- lm(race_time ~ weight + heart_rate + breed, data = horse_data)

# 1. Residual Plot: Check for non-linearity or heteroscedasticity
plot(lm_model$fitted.values, resid(lm_model),
     xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals",
     main = "Residual Plot — Should be a random cloud")
abline(h = 0, col = "red")

# 2. Q-Q Plot: Are residuals normally distributed?
qqnorm(resid(lm_model)); qqline(resid(lm_model), col = "red")

# 3. Histogram of residuals
hist(resid(lm_model), main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab = "Residuals")

# 4. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): Check multicollinearity
# install.packages("car")
library(car)
vif(lm_model)

# 5. Cook's Distance: Find influential points
plot(cooks.distance(lm_model), type = "h",
     main = "Cook’s Distance — Outliers or Influential Horses",
     ylab = "Cook’s Distance")

# 🐎 Example insight:
# "Our model predicting race time is valid. Residuals are roughly normal, no obvious multicollinearity,
# and one particularly fast horse might be unusually influential."
